# About

This is a summary with the core concepts of chapter 01

1. `!` -> simbolizes a macro instead of a function.
2. `rustfmt <file...>` can be used to format the files following rust standards.
3. `cargo` is the build tool for rust.
4. `cargo new <name>` creates a new project.
5. `cargo build` generates the executables.
6. `cargo check` checks whether or not your code compiles:
7. `cargo run` runs the applicaiton.
8. `cargo build --release` generates a prod ready executable (it's slower than a simple build).
